# CO2-Emission-Tableau-Dashboard
Tableau

This repository contains a Tableau dashboard visualizing CO2 emissions data across various regions and countries. The dashboard aims to provide insights into global CO2 production trends, per capita emissions, and the highest CO2-producing countries.

### Key Insights:
1. Top CO2 Emitters: Countries like Qatar, UAE, and Luxembourg have the highest CO2 emissions per capita.
2. Regional Trends:: Regional emissions have steadily increased from 1960 to 2011, with industrialized nations contributing significantly. Emerging economies are catching up, further accelerating global emissions.
3. Global Disparity: The map highlights significant disparities, with developed nations emitting far more per capita than developing regions.

### Recommendations:

1. Accelerate Renewable Energy Adoption: High-emission countries can significantly lower their footprint by investing in solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources.
2. Policy Interventions: Implementing stricter carbon taxes and incentivizing green technologies can reduce industrial emissions.
3. Collaboration: International cooperation is essential to support developing regions in adopting sustainable practices without hindering economic growth.

By identifying high-impact areas and tracking trends, dashboards like this empower data-driven decisions for combating climate change.
